Zeeshan Hashmi 0 minutes 32 seconds
Maybe it could be on the Azure data Azure VM, but we have to have a backup plan if payroll didn't show up and if the tips didn't show up on the daily basis then.
Zeeshan Hashmi 0 minutes 47 seconds
We should be able to trigger something.
Zeeshan Hashmi 0 minutes 51 seconds
Rather than be a reactive, we we should have a proactive approach on this thing.

Bryan Camaglia
1 minute 23 seconds1:23
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 23 seconds
Is there one that's in our control or not?
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 26 seconds
Right. And then you could lay it all out and we can layout the options and then can decide from there like this should be Plan B.

Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 37 seconds
So yeah, we can do that.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
1 minute 40 seconds1:40
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 40 seconds
Because if.
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 42 seconds
If we are looking at in a way that there shouldn't be a failure, then we have to have A at least two agency plan.
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 53 seconds
And whatever the cost is, but apart from cost, we have to have the thing, because otherwise on on on one failure point, no one can guarantees you that the system would be running 100% without without having any issues.

Bryan Camaglia

Zeeshan Hashmi 2 minutes 33 seconds
Different type of incidents coming up for the Floyd and yesterday my entire.
Zeeshan Hashmi 2 minutes 39 seconds
They was taken away on that this EDP thing.
Zeeshan Hashmi 2 minutes 43 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 50 seconds
Ian sent a question, so let's just kind of maybe answer this together.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
5 minutes 53 seconds5:53
Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 53 seconds
Mm hmm.


Bryan Camaglia
5 minutes 55 seconds5:55
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 55 seconds
Thank you.
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 56 seconds
We immediately dropped the corporate file.
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 58 seconds
Yesterday it was processed late, manually processed the data you provided.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 2 seconds
This was good.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 3 seconds
Shane has confirmed corporate tips and we're waiting on sleep confirm.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 7 seconds
Quick question. When I was reviewing everything with John yesterday, he said that there is a direct integration from MYTIME to ADP wisely.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 19 seconds
Do you have any information about this?
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 22 seconds
If not, no worries.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 23 seconds
We'll follow up with my time.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 25 seconds
Just wanted to get started.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 27 seconds
So to answer that.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 32 seconds
There is not a direct integration to my knowledge.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
6 minutes 37 seconds6:37
Zeeshan Hashmi 6 minutes 37 seconds
OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
6 minutes 38 seconds6:38
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 38 seconds
So that's the easy answer.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 40 seconds
Little bit of background is that.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 44 seconds
There were talks that my time was going to integrate with ADP.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 48 seconds
But I one never heard the outcome of that and never heard the official scope of that.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 56 seconds
So I thought the initial scope was just gonna be like employee records like master data stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 5 seconds
I.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 5 seconds
I didn't know transactional data or payroll, but it could have been part of scope and then two, I I'd never heard if they even moved forward with it or anything like that.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 14 seconds
So that that'll be my reply back to.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 20 seconds
Ian, on that.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 21 seconds
So yeah, if they have it. Great. But.


Bryan Camaglia
7 minutes 25 seconds7:25
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 25 seconds
I don't know.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 26 seconds
I I'd be a little surprised it would be great.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 29 seconds
But again, I'd be a little surprised.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 32 seconds
So yeah, so when I looked this morning at the pipelines, right, like all of these ran within, you know, acceptable times.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
7 minutes 42 seconds7:42
Zeeshan Hashmi 7 minutes 42 seconds
One question, Brian, sorry to, OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
7 minutes 44 seconds7:44
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 44 seconds
Nope, that's fine. Good.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
7 minutes 46 seconds7:46
Zeeshan Hashmi 7 minutes 46 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi 7 minutes 48 seconds

BC
Bryan Camaglia
7 minutes 55 seconds7:55
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 55 seconds
The only.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 59 seconds
No.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 2 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi

BC
Bryan Camaglia
8 minutes 10 seconds8:10
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 10 seconds
I I.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 13 seconds
No, no failure. Sorry.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 15 seconds
That's why I we did.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 16 seconds
I did have to rerun.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 18 seconds
I reran one because.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 21 seconds
The files.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 26 seconds
How did we run one?
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 27 seconds
I.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 28 seconds
I don't know and I feel like it was over a month ago, so that's why it's have to dig it up where the file's not ready.

Bryan Camaglia
8 minutes 35 seconds8:35
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 35 seconds
I mean, let's check. Let's see.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 37 seconds
So this job will fail.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 42 seconds
If the shops are closed.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
8 minutes 42 seconds8:42
Zeeshan Hashmi 8 minutes 42 seconds
M.
BC
Bryan Camaglia

Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 46 seconds
So on new on New Year's Day.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
8 minutes 47 seconds8:47
Zeeshan Hashmi 8 minutes 47 seconds
Meaning that.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
8 minutes 51 seconds8:51
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 51 seconds
Right, the shops are closed. So on the 2nd of January these jobs will fail because.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
8 minutes 53 seconds8:53
Zeeshan Hashmi 8 minutes 53 seconds
OK.
Zeeshan Hashmi 8 minutes 56 seconds
Hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
8 minutes 58 seconds8:58
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 58 seconds
There are no one worked, so there's no tips to pay.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 1 second
So first thing you do is if right here see it failed on January 2nd because no one worked on January 1st.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
9 minutes 1 second9:01
Zeeshan Hashmi 9 minutes 1 second
OK.
JC
Josh Courson
9 minutes 7 seconds9:07
Josh Courson 9 minutes 7 seconds
Yeah.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
9 minutes 11 seconds9:11
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 11 seconds
It works on January 1st 'cause people worked on the 31st so so this is the only time that I accept.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
9 minutes 11 seconds9:11
Zeeshan Hashmi 9 minutes 11 seconds
Got you.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
9 minutes 18 seconds9:18
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 18 seconds
A failure.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 18 seconds
So I think I think we're shut.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 21 seconds
Maybe a handful of days, right?
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 22 seconds
Like Christmas Day, New Year's Day, 4th of July.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 26 seconds
I don't know.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 27 seconds
Might be open, I don't know.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 29 seconds
But there's only like a few days a year where the next day after that holiday this will will fail and that's acceptable there.



Bryan Camaglia
9 minutes 39 seconds9:39
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 39 seconds
We had, so this is again the day after Christmas.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
9 minutes 45 seconds9:45
Zeeshan Hashmi 9 minutes 45 seconds
Oh, why it get failed if there is no data? That's why it failed or.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
9 minutes 52 seconds9:52
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 52 seconds
Let's see here.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 53 seconds
Let's see where it failed.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 54 seconds
On which point I'll tell you.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes
So when this started.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 13 seconds
And why did it?
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 14 seconds
It's the fail date.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 30 seconds
And.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 37 seconds
Yeah, because because there are no files, it didn't create a file.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
10 minutes 40 seconds10:40
Zeeshan Hashmi 10 minutes 40 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
10 minutes 43 seconds10:43
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 43 seconds
In.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 50 seconds
Oh, wait a second.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 51 seconds
Maybe This is why it feels 'cause the.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 55 seconds
Threshold. Let me let me look at it.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
11 minutes 16 seconds11:16
Zeeshan Hashmi 11 minutes 16 seconds
So basically this directly fed the data from the ADP only the tips thing.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
11 minutes 28 seconds11:28
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 28 seconds
OK. So, so a couple of things that are in here.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 41 seconds
I think because there was no because no file was produced.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 44 seconds
So here's here's what failed. So.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 49 seconds
We had some problems.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 52 seconds
Again, this was I have battle scars from tips so I'm super sensitive on tips.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 57 seconds
Everything else I'm pretty cool on, but this one.


Bryan Camaglia
12 minutes 1 second12:01
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 1 second
So.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 3 seconds
We had so in the beginning, like we had one instance where Mytime actually produced every file twice.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 10 seconds
So if we had $25,000 worth of tips to pay out, we paid out 50,000, OK. And. And so, you know, there was a lot of lot of growing pain, not a lot, but there were some significant coming pains through this. So because of that.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
12 minutes 16 seconds12:16
Zeeshan Hashmi 12 minutes 16 seconds
Ow OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
12 minutes 26 seconds12:26
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 26 seconds
The way this flow works, maybe we'll just take it down here A level.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 32 seconds
So. So there's two pipelines.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 34 seconds
This is the main pipeline for corporate and then this is the main pipeline for.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 40 seconds
Our franchise and their name night because originally we were doing two runs and it was just a timing thing because sleet was East Coast.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 51 seconds
They wanted it at a different time, later actually than you would think.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 55 seconds
And then corporate needed to have theirs out by a certain time.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 58 seconds
So we ended up with two of them.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 59 seconds
So I'm just going to look at the the regular corporate pipeline here.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 5 seconds
So just to kind of take you through this right, we set up the folders.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 9 seconds
This is how we get the the data.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 11 seconds
We clean our processing table, then basically what we do is we grab every file and consolidate and reformat it.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 19 seconds
That's what this step does.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 21 seconds
Then once it's done, we remove so because the folder that we get from mytime includes everybody, corporate and franchise. When we run corporate, we got to remove the franchise data and vice versa.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
13 minutes 34 seconds13:34
Zeeshan Hashmi 13 minutes 34 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
13 minutes 34 seconds13:34
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 34 seconds
That's the main difference when we run.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 36 seconds
Franchise. We got to remove all the corporate tip data.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 40 seconds
So then.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 41 seconds
That's what these steps do.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 43 seconds
And then then if it all passes and we're saying OK corporate, now we go to the second pipeline, the sub pipeline, if you will.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 51 seconds
And what it does is it's it's copying the the file from storage to storage. If you will, then what we're going to do is we're going to calculate total tips amount that's in that file. And we have a threshold. And so that threshold bumps up and so we.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 5 seconds
Have.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 6 seconds
$70,000. So if corporate is if for some reason.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 10 seconds
The tips are over $70,000.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 12 seconds
The process stops, right?
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 14 seconds
That's to that's to defend against the duplicate.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 17 seconds
Now it has on occasion failed here because let's say it's the day before Christmas or the day before Easter.


Bryan Camaglia
14 minutes 26 seconds14:26
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 26 seconds
You you choose your holiday and you know the shops are just packed, right?
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 32 seconds
And people are tipping it.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 34 seconds
It has happened once or twice over the last number of years that it is stopped and we didn't pay and and that's kind of the emergency.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
14 minutes 37 seconds14:37
Zeeshan Hashmi 14 minutes 37 seconds
Hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
14 minutes 40 seconds14:40
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 40 seconds
Breaker and what happens when we do that is we send an e-mail.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 48 seconds
That goes to AP payroll.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 52 seconds
Or or.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 54 seconds
AP.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 55 seconds
Or it could be payroll. I forget what the generic e-mail address is.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 59 seconds
Oh, it should be right.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes
Here it goes to payroll.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 3 seconds
At Floyd's and says, hey, we either did a warning at 95% of the threshold we I think we continue and then?
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 12 seconds
We send an e-mail and then if it's and then if it's over the threshold.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 16 seconds
So this one says if it's over the threshold, we put the brakes on.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 20 seconds
We said we stop if it actually is at 95%, we will send it, but we will also send the e-mail saying, hey, we hit, we hit 95%.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 31 seconds
So hey, look, maybe we need to bump this threshold up a little bit because you know, maybe we're consistently doing business.

The other side of it is, is that if if we have no one working, no tip files are generated by my time, and so when we pick up we don't produce any files because we didn't produce any files, it can't calculate and move this stuff and it says.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 5 seconds
Whoa, there's no files to do this, so I'm putting the brakes on and that's why you'll get.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 10 seconds
The air on the day after Christmas Day after New Year's.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 13 seconds
And then maybe if they're shut any other other day Thanksgiving, I think I think those are the three days they they shut down.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 21 seconds
So that's why you will see it, I feel like.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 26 seconds
We we had, I I did.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 28 seconds
Now that I talked to her, we had a sleet failure, not a corporate failure.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 34 seconds
And the reason we had a sleuth failure was.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 41 seconds
This was on their side, so in order to pay unwisely, the company.


Bryan Camaglia
16 minutes 48 seconds16:48
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 48 seconds
Floyd's or sleith?
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 50 seconds
The company needs to fund an account because like I said, as soon as it drops in there within minutes they send money to people's accounts to their debit card, if you will. If there's not enough money there, right?
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 1 second
It's like a banking transaction.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 3 seconds
So what happened was Leith about?
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 5 seconds
I don't know. Within the last month or two they did not have their account funded.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 10 seconds
So tips were rejected, but that had nothing to do with us.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 13 seconds
And So what?
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 14 seconds
They asked us to do was rerun it after they funded it.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 17 seconds
So then we reran it.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 19 seconds
But that had nothing to do with our pipelines or our infrastructure.

17 minutes 24 seconds17:24
Zeeshan Hashmi 17 minutes 24 seconds
Mm hmm, got you OK.
Zeeshan Hashmi 17 minutes 26 seconds
One question, if all the data is coming to this pipeline from my time, so why we have named it ADP wisely? Is there any specific reason?
BC
Bryan Camaglia
17 minutes 38 seconds17:38
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 38 seconds
Wisely is the subsidiary of ADP. That fund pays the employees.


Zeeshan Hashmi
17 minutes 41 seconds17:41
Zeeshan Hashmi 17 minutes 41 seconds
OK, OK.
Zeeshan Hashmi 17 minutes 42 seconds

E.

Bryan Camaglia
17 minutes 48 seconds17:48

The the GL is not and I don't think we we don't really, we don't use anything in here.

So this is a dead pipeline, so you can ignore that 40.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
18 minutes 14 seconds18:14
Zeeshan Hashmi 18 minutes 14 seconds
OK, apart from wifely, what are the important pipelines that we have to look into on the daily basis or maybe in the specific time? Because right now I'm thinking in a way that we cannot resolve if we cannot resolve all the issues?
Zeeshan Hashmi 18 minutes 32 seconds
For couple months to at least we should be able to in a in a proactive approach rather than be a reactive approach.


Bryan Camaglia
18 minutes 40 seconds18:40
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah, I think so.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 42 seconds
What I used to do is I would look at that e-mail that you're getting right that does all the refreshes and stuff and then I would look here on this pipeline everyday data factory and and now it's greatly reduced because version one of the warehouse was all cloud.

Here's three jobs to do. The first set of tips.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 29 seconds
Three jobs or two jobs to do the second tips we get survey results from 360.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 36 seconds
And and then we have a couple programs that run.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 40 seconds
On like on a Monday or a periodic basis, this one ran.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 45 seconds
Oh, Thursday, we run a couple periodic basis stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 50 seconds
So you know you're going to have anywhere from, you know, 5 to 8 jobs. And I just look to see if these are all green. Now you you can set up alerts and stuff and.


Zeeshan Hashmi 20 minutes 1 second
Exactly. I'm thinking about to have a set up the pipeline.
Zeeshan Hashmi 20 minutes 6 seconds
Those are running more than 10 minutes or 15 minutes. We should get the alert.

Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 25 seconds
You know, we we did.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 27 seconds
We got the 8090% and we left 10% and I said well, let's leave the operational stuff and then when we have time, let's move that.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 36 seconds
But then you know we move that and then we didn't get to it. And then all of a sudden, now we're moving it to the VM version three and some of this stuff lags behind.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 46 seconds
There's there's no. Well, there's.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 51 seconds
Umm.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 52 seconds
Philosophically, there's no reason why we can't get everything off of here.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 57 seconds
Legitimately, we can't because we can only talked to, you know, this one. We could probably do.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 5 seconds
We just haven't done it.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 6 seconds
Listen 360, we just have to rebuild the API.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 12 seconds
This send punches.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 14 seconds
Basically send the timecard.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 16 seconds
This issue is that we don't have the credentials to the S3 bucket.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 21 seconds
Because we don't have the secret key, mytime doesn't.


Bryan Camaglia
21 minutes 24 seconds21:24
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 24 seconds
We have to basically set up a new one.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 26 seconds
So basically time cards.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 29 seconds
Which we haven't gone over yet.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 30 seconds
Which we can do either tomorrow or next week, right? Is the back half right?
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 34 seconds
We do schedules which is fine, but then the time cards the last step of time cards is we drop the CSV into the Amazon S3 bucket.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 43 seconds
Well, the problem is, is that we we don't have those credentials and that's a little bit of the problem.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 48 seconds
Why wisely tips is there too 'cause we don't have the credentials.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 52 seconds
So the credentials are locked here in the data factory activity and that's the only way I can get them out automatically until we reestablish those credentials or get a new set with the new key.


Bryan Camaglia
22 minutes 4 seconds22:04
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 4 seconds
So that was set up before me and that secret key was never.

Zeeshan Hashmi

Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 44 seconds
And I and I don't know if they're like, I know you had the credentials for the S3 explorer 'cause. I think you even got Josh set up. I don't know if those are the same credentials or if they're different.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 54 seconds
We can.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 54 seconds
We can peak.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 55 seconds
We could find out.

Zeeshan Hashmi 23 minutes 19 seconds
Would work.
Zeeshan Hashmi 23 minutes 20 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi 23 minutes 29 seconds
Now see.

Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 39 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 24 minutes 52 seconds
You know, at some point on your list we we need to get another.
Bryan Camaglia 24 minutes 56 seconds
Configure another set up and then we can move this off data factory and we can move this into SSIS and on Prem it.


Zeeshan Hashmi

Zeeshan Hashmi 25 minutes 11 seconds
Uh huh.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
25 minutes 13 seconds25:13
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 13 seconds
The reason these jobs run forever is because I kick them off and they're waiting for that file to be done.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 19 seconds
They're waiting.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 20 seconds
And then once the file's done, it picks it up and moves it.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 22 seconds
So this is just moving the file to my time.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 25 seconds
That's all that does here.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 29 seconds
So anyway, so yeah.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 34 seconds
Here we go.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 38 seconds
So.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 41 seconds
Do do you have move on?
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 44 seconds
Do you have other questions?
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 45 seconds
Do you have a specific topic?
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 47 seconds
If not, I'll pick another topic.

Apart from these tips.
Zeeshan Hashmi 25 minutes 53 seconds
You showed me the ether process as well.
Zeeshan Hashmi 25 minutes 57 seconds
Is there anything which is linked with the payroll?
Zeeshan Hashmi 25 minutes 59 seconds
Because I believe on every Tuesday the payroll is runs and the next payroll would be on Tuesday.

Bryan Camaglia
26 minutes 8 seconds26:08
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 8 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi 26 minutes 12 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
26 minutes 13 seconds26:13
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 13 seconds
So the Tuesday job, which are very they're very straightforward.


Bryan Camaglia
26 minutes 21 seconds26:21
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 21 seconds
All we're doing is pulling all the files.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 26 seconds
For corporate, which I don't know how many there are, I forget Josh. I don't know if you remember, but it was like 68, mainly yeah.
JC
Josh Courson
26 minutes 34 seconds26:34
Josh Courson 26 minutes 34 seconds
I think it was 68, yeah.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
26 minutes 37 seconds26:37
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 37 seconds
So basically all we're doing is we're pulling the 68 files, we're consolidating them.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 44 seconds
And creating one file and not even doing a whole lot of transformation, meaning we're we're not doing a whole lot of math on there.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
26 minutes 53 seconds26:53
Zeeshan Hashmi 26 minutes 53 seconds
M.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
26 minutes 53 seconds26:53
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 53 seconds
Arithmetic however you want to say it, and we do that twice 'cause it needs it in two different formats.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes
So job one, we grab them, do one CSV output, we do it again out same 68 files and output.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 9 seconds
And then payroll has access to the BLOB storage folder which it goes in.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 14 seconds
So I'll show you.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 15 seconds
Where where this is right?
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 16 seconds
So so the the.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 21 seconds
The payroll is going to be done.

Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 25 seconds
In.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 26 seconds
Workforce now, sorry.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 29 seconds
So we have these last two jobs under here.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 32 seconds
Payroll Commission Tips Payroll Commission tips report. So these two reports are pretty darn identical if you look at them.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 42 seconds
So we'll start with this one, right.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 43 seconds
We do a setup which says where do I get it?
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 46 seconds
I'm gonna clear my processing table.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 48 seconds
I'm gonna get every one of those files.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 51 seconds
I'm gonna consolidate them into one BLOB storage.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 55 seconds
I'm gonna move them to another BLOB storage.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 56 seconds
Storage and that's it.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 58 seconds
And then payroll knows how to get it out of the Azure BLOB storage.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 3 seconds
The the BLOB side, we were the person who set it up initially was dumping them both into the BLOB as well as the file side of storage I think.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 15 seconds
I cut.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 16 seconds
I think I cut the file side off, but it's always in the BLOB and so.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 21 seconds
And then I'll show you where that is in a second.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 23 seconds
And then this is the other one which you can see is the exact same thing.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 28 seconds
Brings them, puts them in there and consolidate them.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 32 seconds
I mean it's the extract is a little different.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 34 seconds
So the the files are different. One maybe has four columns and one has like 6 columns or something like that and so where it dumps them is if we go into.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 45 seconds
This mytime data import so. So the main 2 storage accounts that we have data. Is this mytime data import and then this franchise data?
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 56 seconds
As we learned yesterday through our tips escapade, right, the tips file for the franchise for Sleeeth will go into here, and that's about the only thing that goes in there.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 7 seconds
That's the only thing we do for, for, for sleeve.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 10 seconds
And we don't do anything like this for any other franchise. And then in here this mytime, this is where we do move data in and out.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 18 seconds
Through our various processes.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 20 seconds
So if I go into the mytime data import right, we've got BLOB and file.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 25 seconds
So it was being dumped into both.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 28 seconds
I started cutting out the file 'cause. It was just way too redundant and this and that.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 31 seconds
So if I go into the BLOB storage right, I have all these containers and.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 39 seconds
The ones these are used in various moments.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 41 seconds
We don't use MailChimp anymore.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 42 seconds
It's done in moments. Done. We do use some MPs which stands for Net Promoter Score, which is a marketing thing. And so we go between both ADP import and ADP.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 54 seconds
This was supposed to be like in the ADP out of ADP.
Bryan Camaglia 29 minutes 57 seconds
But that that kind of fell a little bit to the wayside.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes
So you may have to look in both adps.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 2 seconds
So, right.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 3 seconds
Like so in this ADP import, there's nothing on this particular one.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 8 seconds
So if I go into adpi have 5 folders which are relevant to the day-to-day world, right?
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 15 seconds
So the two jobs that I just showed you one dumps in the payroll, one dumps in the payroll reports.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 21 seconds
So if I go into here.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 24 seconds
We'll look at.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 30 seconds
25.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 32 seconds
Right, so this was the first one. So you're right on.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 37 seconds
The 6th. So on the 20th, which is Tuesday.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 40 seconds
You will see another payroll report in here that that shows up.
Bryan Camaglia 30 minutes 46 seconds
If you go back to the payroll report.

Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 21 seconds
And so between the punches by the employee and the schedules from my time, ADP creates time cards.
Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 29 seconds
The time cards then move back into mytime because then my time needs to calculate commissions.

The Commission engine is there and so then ultimately we have two components to a paycheck, right?
Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 43 seconds
You have your base pay and your Commission or your bonus. However you want to say it right.
Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 49 seconds
So ADP calculates the base part of it.
Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 54 seconds
And what we have to do then we have to close the last part. We have to move.

The Commission data from my time back in the ADP so that it can all come together and do a final process of your paycheck.

Bryan Camaglia
32 minutes 10 seconds32:10
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 10 seconds
Right. So yeah, the name is probably not the best.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 14 seconds
So the reason it's called Commission tips is because also in my time is the tips that were paid out to employees which we just lived through yesterday, right?
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 25 seconds
So I just paid Bob 50 bucks.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 28 seconds
Well, I have to report that on my ADP.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 30 seconds
So my time will send hey I, by the way, I'm gonna pay Bob Commission.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 36 seconds
I'm gonna give him $100 for product Commission.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 38 seconds
I'm gonna give him $300.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 41 seconds
For Service Commission and by the way, I paid Bob $50.00 in tips so that goes into ADP.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 46 seconds
So then ADP can do all the math it has to what's taxable? What's not.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 50 seconds
Maybe they do a higher or lower.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 51 seconds
Maybe they Pay Commission over hourly rate or they pay a blend or whatever they do in there.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 57 seconds
That's why that's what's in these two two files.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 2 seconds
The reasons?
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 3 seconds
There's two files is one is in the format which ADP likes.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 7 seconds
And the other one is in the format which payroll can do and validate again.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 10 seconds
So it's a little bit more robust, has more information, but is more of a report where the ADP file version is more of just an upload version.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 27 seconds
So you'll have a file in both of these places. If something goes left.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 31 seconds
Typically what I do is before I run those jobs, I come in here and I delete it.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 35 seconds
So like the issue we had, I think in the last payroll two weeks ago, my time did not have the files ready in time.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 43 seconds
So we grabbed.

Yes.

Bryan Camaglia
33 minutes 44 seconds33:44
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 44 seconds
We grabbed 4 files, were only produced instead of the 68, so we produced and we dropped them in here and it looked like so then that's when.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 54 seconds
The alarm bells went off and everyone had a.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 56 seconds
A frantic moment.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 58 seconds
So then I said, hold on, they're there now.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 1 second
We rerun it, so I deleted the current files and reran it, and then the new files were in there on that. So to your point that you're probably gonna ask next.

Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 39 seconds
And you know, new shiny object comes along and we go on to the next project.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 43 seconds
But yes, we could.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 45 seconds
You know, before we finish up here or even before we start, right.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 50 seconds
First thing we do is we set the parameters and then we could go do a check.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 53 seconds
Just kind of like we do a threshold check.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 55 seconds
On tips we could go. Hey, how many files are in that folder?
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 59 seconds
Less than 68 send an e-mail right and stop the process. We could do that.


Bryan Camaglia
35 minutes 5 seconds35:05
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 5 seconds
Just need to go ahead, but that's that's the process and you can you can run this as many times as you want, right?
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 15 seconds
The only job.
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 17 seconds
Well, I shouldn't say the only job. Tips.
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 18 seconds
You cannot run as many times as you want.
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 21 seconds
You really gotta know where it failed and what happened and where it is in the process.
Bryan Camaglia 35 minutes 25 seconds
Nice. So you don't? Yep.

Zeeshan Hashmi
35 minutes 26 seconds35:26
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 26 seconds
And because we want to avoid the duplication.
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 29 seconds
So if let's suppose if anything get fails on the daily tip.
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 35 seconds
So how we would ensure that, OK, there shouldn't be a any existent existing file?
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 40 seconds
That could be a problematic for the duplication. For example, if there is any file on the storage so so that should be removed or what?
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 51 seconds
What would?
Zeeshan Hashmi 35 minutes 51 seconds
What would be the process for for that failure?

It did not include half of the file. Yes, yes.

Bryan Camaglia
36 minutes 8 seconds36:08
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 8 seconds

BC
Bryan Camaglia
36 minutes 18 seconds36:18
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 18 seconds
Yeah, right.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 19 seconds
So. So what I this requires everyone working together.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 23 seconds
Not, you know, everyone working in a silo and I and I, you know, I mean, come on. Let's all get together. Right. And so first thing we do is we would look at the file that was produced and then I would go to payroll and say can you?

Bryan Camaglia
36 minutes 38 seconds36:38
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 38 seconds
Go verify with end wisely that this was funded and if they say no, it was not funded, then we need to see where that file is and talk to wisely and say.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 49 seconds
Hey, did you receive this file?
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 51 seconds
Is it stuck on your side or is it stuck on our side right Causeway? If it's stuck on their side and we send it again and they unstuck it for better, better word, right then all of a sudden half the people got double funded, right? And then if?
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 4 seconds
They say no, we have no record of it and we confirm we can send it again.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 7 seconds
Then we could start the process again from the beginning and send the whole file.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 12 seconds
Let's say that, OK, half those people did get funded.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 15 seconds
Well, what we can do is go into the S3 bucket.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 18 seconds
It move the locations that got funded into a temporary folder and then leave the ones that did in the folder. Then run this process and then it could send the other half if you will right.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 30 seconds
So it's just it just requires very precise analysis and and do it.

Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 36 seconds
It's not complicated, fortunately, right?
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 39 seconds
Like moving schedules and moving time cards.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 42 seconds
Some of the OR some complicated processes, relatively speaking, but.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 46 seconds
This is a pretty straightforward it just.

Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 23 seconds
It's a it's a fairly straightforward process.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 26 seconds
You know probably about 5 steps.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 28 seconds
It's just, you know, the repercussions of not understanding just those five steps could be more headaches for people. That's all right.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 37 seconds
So it's not.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 38 seconds
It's not a complex thing, so I don't want to confuse the two.


Zeeshan Hashmi
38 minutes 43 seconds38:43
Zeeshan Hashmi 38 minutes 43 seconds
Got you.
Zeeshan Hashmi 38 minutes 44 seconds
So in a nutshell, right now there are two operations or you can say there are two pipelines that is more complex, not complex, but we have to have a keep an eye if these are working. First one is under the ADP0030-A A.

39 minutes 26 seconds39:26
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 26 seconds
So the only.
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 29 seconds
The only thing under here is this has all been shut off, so this used to be the old process for moving schedules and time cards. This is all now.

Zeeshan Hashmi
39 minutes 29 seconds39:29
Zeeshan Hashmi 39 minutes 29 seconds
The E time and the.
Zeeshan Hashmi 39 minutes 33 seconds
OK.
Zeeshan Hashmi 39 minutes 37 seconds
Can we rename it to that it is no longer in use because it it might confused to me and to Josh as well while creating the documentation or the flow diagram you have a better understanding because you you've been dealing with this pipeline since last 3-4 years.
Zeeshan Hashmi 39 minutes 55 seconds
So if if the process which is which is not being used, can we can we rename it in in a way OK if not?
Zeeshan Hashmi 40 minutes 5 seconds
Archive yes.
Zeeshan Hashmi 40 minutes 6 seconds
Something, yes.
Zeeshan Hashmi 40 minutes 9 seconds

The pipeline here, like I said, was corporate.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 7 seconds
Then it calls this. This send tips corporate. OK, this night one does the franchise. This one I created this. No. Send so that if I needed to run the pipeline without it actually dropping the file then I would switch over to this one.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 23 seconds
So this is not active, but it's meant for, you know, break fix purposes.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 29 seconds
The only one I don't know this get token.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 31 seconds
I'm not sure, so I'm gonna leave these here.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 34 seconds
For now, because.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 36 seconds
Four are definitely used.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 37 seconds
One could be used if you need to and I would just have to see what's in this access token, but I don't think it works so.

Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 30 seconds

We can do that with.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 11 seconds
Chasm as well.

Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 34 seconds
HR will come back to.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 37 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 48 minutes 22 seconds
They're archived and this is.
Bryan Camaglia 48 minutes 27 seconds
Pretty sure this is all archived too, because we shut that all down.
