Project Plan: SQL Server Performance and Configuration Remediation
1. Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to improve SQL Server performance, reliability, and recoverability through optimized configurations, maintenance practices, and security enhancements.
2. Scope of Work
| Task | Description | Estimated Time | Downtime Required |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Server Sizing | Add memory and adjust MAXDOP settings. | 30 minutes | Yes, restart required |
| DBCC CHECKDB | Schedule and perform weekly integrity checks. | 5-6 hours total | No |
| TempDB Optimization | Move TempDB to a dedicated drive. | 1 hour | Yes |
| Instant File Initialization (IFI) | Enable IFI to reduce overhead and downtime for file extensions. | 30 minutes | Yes, restart required |
| Maintenance Plans | Set up agent jobs for index reorganization, rebuilds, and statistics updates. | 5-10 hours | No |
| Security Enhancements | Patch SQL Server, audit SA accounts, and adjust job ownership to service accounts. | 4 weeks, 1 hour/week | Minimal |
| Performance Tuning | Analyze unused/missing indexes, optimize queries, and address parameterization issues. | 10-30 hours | No |
| Disk Configuration | Migrate data, log, and TempDB files to separate drives with 64K cluster size. | 2-8 hours | Yes, full outage |
| VLF Count Reduction | Resize transaction logs to optimize virtual log file count. | 2-4 hours | Yes |
| Query Store Configuration | Enable Query Store for query plan monitoring and optimization. | 3-8 hours | No |
| Backup Strategy | Implement a robust backup schedule (daily FULL, hourly transaction logs). | 3-8 hours + 3 hours audit | No |

3. Timeline

The project will be executed starting Jan 4th, 2025
   - Server Sizing
   - TempDB Optimization
   - Instant File Initialization
   - Disk Configuration

   - Backup Strategy implementation and validation

4. Assumptions
- Downtime will be scheduled during off-peak hours.
- SQL Server access will be provided with necessary permissions.
- Storage requirements (additional drives) will be fulfilled prior to scheduled tasks.
5. Deliverables
- Updated SQL Server configurations and best-practice documentation.
- Performance improvement metrics.
- Maintenance plans and job schedules.
- Validated backup and recovery strategy.
- Summary report of completed optimizations.
6. Dependencies
- Procurement of additional memory and storage.
- Scheduled maintenance windows for tasks requiring downtime.
7. Project Risks
- Extended downtime if unforeseen issues arise during migrations.
- Temporary performance impact during reindexing or maintenance tasks.
