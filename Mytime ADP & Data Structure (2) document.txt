# Mytime/ADP Data Structure - Additional Documentation

## Schedule Processing Details

### Schedule Job Timing
1. **Daily Schedule Processing**
   - Schedules process once per night at 11:15 PM
   - Pulls schedules for next two weeks
   - Not considered critical emergency unless during payroll close

2. **Time Card Processing**
   - Runs twice daily:
     - First run: ~10:00 PM
     - Second run: ~5:00 AM
   - Critical during payroll close periods

### Critical Periods
1. **Payroll Close (Every Two Weeks)**
   - Monday night after payroll period closes
   - Period closes on Sunday
   - Final updates made Monday
   - Critical run at 10:00 PM Monday
   - Payroll reports generate from this data

## Server Infrastructure

### Server Distribution
1. **dataintO2**
   - Acts as gateway server
   - Handles ADP communication
   - Limited processing capacity
   - Runs schedule jobs (takes ~2 hours)

2. **az01-db01**
   - Main processing server
   - Handles heavy processing tasks
   - Currently cannot directly communicate with ADP

### Data Processing Flow
```
    A[Mytime Schedule Data] --> B[dataintO2]
    B --> C[Initial Processing]
    C --> D[Heavy Processing on az01-db01]
    D --> E[Final Processing on dataintO2]
    E --> F[Send to ADP]
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Failed Job Recovery
1. **T-1 Recovery Process**
   - Special jobs created for recovery
   - Adjusts date parameters automatically
   - Example:
     - Regular job: Today + 2 weeks
     - T-1 job: Yesterday + 2 weeks

2. **Manual Recovery Steps**
   ```sql
   -- Date adjustment for recovery
   SET @StartDate = DATEADD(day, -1, GETDATE())
   SET @EndDate = DATEADD(day, 13, @StartDate)
   ```

### Priority Levels
1. **Normal Schedule Failures**
   - Can be resolved next morning
   - No immediate business impact
   - Stores can continue operations

2. **Critical Failures**
   - Payroll close period failures
   - Finance department impacts
   - Requires immediate attention
   - May need Mytime involvement for report regeneration

## Future Improvements

1. **Server Consolidation**
   - Goal: Move all processing to az01-db01
   - Requires ADP communication capability on az01-db01
   - Would simplify processing flow
   - Reduce server dependencies

2. **Process Optimization**
   - Reduce processing time from current 2-hour window
   - Better resource utilization
   - Improved monitoring capabilities
