Meeting with Don and Zeeshan. Discussed about the direction of the project.

Need to prepare the documentation of last meeting.
What is the issue?
When run in the payroll, there were only because the azure data factory gets the only four files.
How we can get notification that all of the Excel files has not been uploaded to the Azure Data factory?


Need to implement early notification system for payroll file processing:

- Azure Data Factory should verify 60 files are present before processing
- System should count CSV files and send notification if any are missing
- Two notification options:
  1. Email alert if MyTime files incomplete
  2. Internal notification if files not received by deadline
- Early notification allows manual payroll run if needed
- Process flow: MyTime schedules -> S3 bucket -> Azure Data Factory -> ADP
