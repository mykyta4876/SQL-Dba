Now we need to figure it out that how we can put the you know, the things on the ADP that it should be able to calculate that 68 file.

I'll I'll, I'll try to some do some research over the weekend and probably by next week we should be able to implement this thing as well.

Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 2 seconds
And which when you say ADADP say that, yeah.
ZH

Zeeshan Hashmi
1 minute 7 seconds1:07
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 7 seconds
80 Sorry Azure Data Factory we had.
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 11 seconds
We have to calculate the, you know, the 68 files for the payroll.
BC

Bryan Camaglia
1 minute 15 seconds1:15
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 15 seconds
Right.
ZH

Zeeshan Hashmi
1 minute 16 seconds1:16
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 16 seconds
So I'll figure it out over the weekend that how we can implement this condition over the pipeline.
BC

Bryan Camaglia
1 minute 26 seconds1:26
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 26 seconds
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 27 seconds
Yeah. So.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
1 minute 28 seconds1:28
Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 28 seconds
Or or maybe if you could, you could tell us if you have anything in your mind.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
1 minute 33 seconds1:33
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 33 seconds
Yeah.
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 37 seconds
Here I will share my screen.

Zeeshan Hashmi 1 minute 42 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
1 minute 48 seconds1:48
Bryan Camaglia 1 minute 48 seconds
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 9 seconds
And so we'll just do.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 13 seconds
A. No, not tonight.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 28 seconds
So let's see here.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 42 seconds
So if we look at this git meta, so we're gonna.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 48 seconds
These little pop ups.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 50 seconds
So let's look at the tip last night, right?
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 53 seconds
So I think this is probably maybe the track to go down.
Bryan Camaglia 2 minutes 57 seconds
You want to research it.
That'd be great.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes
Or you know.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 3 seconds
Let's see.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 3 seconds
So this was the corporate one at 6:30.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 9 seconds
Right. If we look at.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 18 seconds
Get metadata here. So let's take a look at that step.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 23 seconds
Get metadata here, right? So the output.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 32 seconds
Right, so it names each file.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 35 seconds
So then we go to.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 38 seconds
Here the filter.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 44 seconds
Right. So we get 81, but we have to delete.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 49 seconds
The non whatever.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 51 seconds
But still 81 is a is a fair enough one.
Bryan Camaglia 3 minutes 53 seconds
So what you can do is you'll find right, you basically if you could get this value which you can and what you can do it it, it's up to you Zeeshan if you want to mess around with it and see what he could do is right. So what?
You want is this count here?
Right. And so.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 14 seconds
Where and it's.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 18 seconds
But XML I think it is in there and so.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 22 seconds
I have in a couple other of these.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 25 seconds
Like here and you could do an if condition right coming out of there.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 29 seconds
Oops, sorry this is the log. Let me go into the actual pipeline.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 34 seconds
So right, if you come into here under activity.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 39 seconds
And you can see how it does right like so.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 41 seconds
This 2 lower pipeline what this is is that.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 47 seconds
This is a parameter.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 48 seconds
This is actually looking at parameter, but what you can also look at is the last activity, so activity output.
Bryan Camaglia 4 minutes 55 seconds
So do we have right here the meta right. If you grab this?
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 1 second
And then what you can see is then you got to do dot dot dot which is basically going down the XML tree, right?
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 8 seconds
And you can get that value of 81.

So you could do something like, hey, if it's greater than 80, right?
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 15 seconds
Then continue.

Zeeshan Hashmi

Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 16 seconds

Bryan Camaglia
5 minutes 16 seconds5:16
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 16 seconds
If not, then do something else so you can kind of mirror this stuff as well.
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 22 seconds
So what I can do here for you?
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 25 seconds
So I'm going to do this.
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 26 seconds
I'm going to clone this.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
5 minutes 28 seconds5:28
Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 28 seconds
Yes, definitely.

Bryan Camaglia
5 minutes 30 seconds5:30
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 30 seconds
Yeah. Yeah, no, I know, right?
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 32 seconds
And so we're just gonna, you know, name it.
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 36 seconds
I'm just gonna name. We could always change this name too, but I'm just gonna name it test.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
5 minutes 40 seconds5:40
Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 40 seconds
Test and this code clone. So I would clearly remember this thing immediately.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
5 minutes 46 seconds5:46
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 46 seconds
And and then what we're gonna do?
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
5 minutes 48 seconds5:48
Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 48 seconds
And disconnect the storage right now, because it shouldn't go to the storage because otherwise it won't have a confusion.
Zeeshan Hashmi 5 minutes 56 seconds
Right.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
5 minutes 57 seconds5:57
Bryan Camaglia 5 minutes 57 seconds
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 4 seconds
Or is it? Is it this one?
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 7 seconds
If.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 10 seconds
Yeah, I'm gonna delete this whole back end. OK. 'cause, this is where it's gonna get 81, but it's either gonna remove corporate or it's gonna remove whatever. What have you.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
6 minutes 13 seconds6:13
Zeeshan Hashmi 6 minutes 13 seconds
Mm hmm.

Actually could.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 23 seconds
Probably even.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 26 seconds
We'll just get rid of. We'll we'll leave that one.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 28 seconds
But I'm gonna get rid of this.

Zeeshan Hashmi

Zeeshan Hashmi 6 minutes 29 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi 6 minutes 33 seconds
Yes.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
6 minutes 34 seconds6:34
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 34 seconds
Right. So if we delete that.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 40 seconds
Delete so.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 44 seconds
This will set it.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 45 seconds
The only thing is is that.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 49 seconds
This table that it uses.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 51 seconds
Is used by the actual.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 54 seconds
Pipeline, right?
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 55 seconds
So just make sure it's not running.
Bryan Camaglia 6 minutes 58 seconds
So I don't think you're going to be doing anything at 6:30 in the morning, but the other one runs at 7:00 in the morning. So I would say stay away from it until at least 7:30, right. If you're gonna start messing around with this.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 12 seconds
Or what have you.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 12 seconds
So so here you've got.
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 16 seconds
The test one if you wanna kinda mess around with it and look in the other pipeline, see what it do. But basically right, you want the output of this which will will come back to it here.


Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 36 seconds
The meta right?
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 39 seconds
Either you could do figure out how do you account for the the real one would be easier.

Bryan Camaglia
7 minutes 58 seconds7:58
Bryan Camaglia 7 minutes 58 seconds
Filter. I'm just gonna.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 2 seconds
Oh, let me do an if.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 3 seconds
So if we go to general.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 9 seconds
Where's the?
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 12 seconds
Conditional maybe?
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 13 seconds
There it is.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 14 seconds
So if I drag the.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 17 seconds
I'm just gonna put it out here for a second.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 20 seconds
I thought I did.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 25 seconds
Much easier on a bigger screen. I just don't have my screen today.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 31 seconds
Right. So now if I go into here activities.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 37 seconds
So.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 42 seconds
Oh, that's.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 45 seconds
The if condition name description.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 51 seconds
Oh, here we go.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 52 seconds
So then you can do this.
Bryan Camaglia 8 minutes 55 seconds
Oh, shoot, nothing's coming out. So let's connect it.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 2 seconds
Make this a little bigger.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 7 seconds
And now let's go into the.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 11 seconds
Click on here.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 13 seconds
So the output was filter daily tips filter, daily tips, and so the output's gonna give you everything.
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 21 seconds
So you're gonna now need to narrow it down to where you want it out of that XML response, right?


Bryan Camaglia
9 minutes 26 seconds9:26
Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 26 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 9 minutes 59 seconds
Bi, at least to start with.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 1 second
I think 1 how I deploy stuff with Steven and then two. I saw this e-mail come back.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 8 seconds
We can look into this.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 11 seconds
That we got.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 13 seconds
From support right on these people.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 15 seconds
So how does that sound?


Bryan Camaglia
10 minutes 17 seconds10:17

Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 20 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 36 seconds

Zeeshan Hashmi 10 minutes 40 seconds
Hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
10 minutes 44 seconds10:44

Jim wanted us to, you know, develop locally versus on a jump box.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 48 seconds
You know pros, cons.

Zeeshan Hashmi
10 minutes 50 seconds10:50
Zeeshan Hashmi 10 minutes 50 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
10 minutes 50 seconds10:50
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 50 seconds
Whatever. What have you.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 51 seconds
But these reports stayed here.
Bryan Camaglia 10 minutes 53 seconds
There's no reason why they can't move to another box or anything, but you know that's for you down the road.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 1 second
This is a souped up box, or it's got decent resources, so it might be a little expensive, but if they're looking to cut costs but power BI development is just a heavy heavy application. So.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 15 seconds
That's why we've kept it there. So. So if you go into this machine.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 21 seconds
On the E drive.


Bryan Camaglia
11 minutes 24 seconds11:24
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 24 seconds
Right. So I'll go through here.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 25 seconds
E Drive Power BI reports.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 29 seconds
And then you're gonna have a few directories, right?
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 33 seconds
So final power BI reports here.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 35 seconds
This was kind of our version one data warehouse.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 39 seconds
This is where the reports are and these reports all point to all the SQL databases.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 47 seconds
So once those go away, these reports won't work.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 50 seconds
They're not being refreshed or anything like that.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 53 seconds
Then we moved the data warehouse to DC1.
Bryan Camaglia 11 minutes 57 seconds
So I had the development reports in here and then anything that was going to production was in here.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 3 seconds
So this got skinny down a little bit, so if we go into here, what do we got?
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 8 seconds
40 reports.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 10 seconds
So we moved.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 10 seconds
Here we did a call of the list and so as you can see we we went down to 16 reports.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 19 seconds
That.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 19 seconds
That were active and then now that we've moved to AZ 01.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 24 seconds
These are the live ones again the 16.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 26 seconds
So so this is this is what I should mirror everything.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 33 seconds
That's on the web.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 34 seconds
So that the people that use power Bi see. OK, so then what? What I do from here?
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 45 seconds
I have in here this forever long. This a lot of these should probably be in Arizona.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 52 seconds
One power Bi dev if you will.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 56 seconds
Or archive.
Bryan Camaglia 12 minutes 57 seconds
So what I do is that when I get a new version of a report, first thing I do is I change like SST and then I put today's date on it and then I brings the new SST report into this folder and I'll show you that in a.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 11 seconds
2nd.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 12 seconds
'Cause. So if you go down so Steven has done all these releases.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 16 seconds
And he used to version them. And then finally, I just said, just stop verging them right.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 21 seconds
So we just put a date on it here. So for obvious reasons, if we need to rollback.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 25 seconds
We can kinda rollback a bit on on this stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 29 seconds
Probably you know from a storage perspective, we could probably delete some of these old ones, but that that's kind of the mentality there.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 37 seconds
So what Steven does.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 39 seconds
So Steven.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 41 seconds
Let me go into these final reports here real quickly. Steven only really develops on three of these.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 50 seconds
He does the SST, the walk out in the snapshot.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 53 seconds
He does these three.


Bryan Camaglia
13 minutes 56 seconds13:56
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 56 seconds
And then the rest.
Bryan Camaglia 13 minutes 58 seconds
I have maintained.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 1 second
And and and deployed in. Everything of that nature.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 3 seconds
Now he may add some.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 4 seconds
I don't know if he does then then that would be another one to add to the list. But generally speaking I don't really go into these and maintain if you're bored one day and you wanna see go in, look and you'll understand why I just haven't had the.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 16 seconds
Time to really understand it.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 19 seconds
But there is one important thing.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 21 seconds
So, you know, let me kind of highlight something here. You can see his reports are.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 26 seconds
Huge.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 27 seconds
Right. Well, except for this.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
14 minutes 28 seconds14:28
Zeeshan Hashmi 14 minutes 28 seconds
Yep.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
14 minutes 28 seconds14:28
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 28 seconds
Walkout this walkout used to be as large as this, so Steven basically built the warehouse gold layer all in power BI.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 40 seconds
And so we've had conversations around like Steven that that really should be in the in the database.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 45 seconds
That's where it's more efficient, right?
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 47 seconds
Because these are the sizes that the reports should be.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 52 seconds
Power Bi maxes out right around here.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 55 seconds
It maxes out at about a gig.
Bryan Camaglia 14 minutes 57 seconds
And this is compressed gig, not just loose gig, right?
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 1 second
I guess for lack of a better word, meaning, you know, compresses out all the empties and nulls and stuff that it can, so he's against the wall on this and and so that's a detriment #1 #2.


Bryan Camaglia
15 minutes 17 seconds15:17
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 17 seconds
If he you know if he gets much bigger, then he's got to start cutting it.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 21 seconds
The second thing is that the refresh takes longer, so he he had the mentality where he wanted to keep all the KPIs.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 28 seconds
In here and then he wanted to branch off.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 30 seconds
So he had a a vision.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 33 seconds
I we didn't really get it to work and I'm not really sure if that's how power BI was meant to be used, so we've just had some discussions, but the bottom line is I'm like we we really should move some of that stuff 'cause. He's got a lot.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 47 seconds
Of data in here that's not being used for SST.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 51 seconds
Right. Because it's just a lot of redundant.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 53 seconds
So we could go off on that, you know, philosophy, whatever, what have you but.
Bryan Camaglia 15 minutes 59 seconds
Bottom line is, is that occasionally, if he pushes over the limit and you try to deploy it and get an error, you might start get the error that it's too big.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
16 minutes 3 seconds16:03
Zeeshan Hashmi 16 minutes 3 seconds
None.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
16 minutes 9 seconds16:09
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 9 seconds
And that's why because it can only be a gig.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 12 seconds
And he's bumping against that. So that's more of just a A for your, for your knowledge.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 16 seconds
So when Steven does development, he's on the same box.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
16 minutes 18 seconds16:18
Zeeshan Hashmi 16 minutes 18 seconds
Mm hmm.
Zeeshan Hashmi 16 minutes 21 seconds
OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
16 minutes 22 seconds16:22
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 22 seconds
He goes into E.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 22 seconds
He has his own.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 26 seconds
Workspace where he does stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 27 seconds
So if you go into the sandbox and then he goes into this semantic and then he has, we created this folder called to deploy and so he he really shouldn't have anything in here to be honest with you.


Bryan Camaglia
16 minutes 42 seconds16:42
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 42 seconds
But he does, and that's alright.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 44 seconds
It doesn't impact me, but what I've told him I said listen, if you want anything to develop, you need to 1st.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 52 seconds
Here, grab the report.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 53 seconds
Move it over here.
Bryan Camaglia 16 minutes 55 seconds
Do your development and save it, and then when he's ready to deploy, he'll say, hey, Brian, in the deploy folder, take this particular report and bring it over.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 5 seconds
And so typically, he'll have just either snapshot walk out or SST. And what I'll do is I'll I'll first obviously rename this, then I will cut it out of here, I will actually.
ZH

Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 23 seconds
And then I'll bring it over here.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 26 seconds
And then for the sake of time, I'm just gonna bring up a smaller report. Right. I'll open it.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 37 seconds
And then basically I'll, I'll do two things.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 40 seconds
Well, actually three things including deploying it.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 44 seconds
I will open it up and and just sanity check it to make sure that it opens and you know that it that data is there.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 53 seconds
It's not all aired out and messaging, you know, all all kinds of wacky stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 17 minutes 58 seconds
And then I will do a refresh myself and make sure that doesn't error out.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 3 seconds
Because if it looks bad or if it errors out, it's gonna look bad.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 7 seconds
Add her air out when we publish it and right. So just kind of quality control, if you will.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 15 seconds
In there so.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 18 seconds
Just give it a second power. Like I said, Power Bi is kinda heavy heavy application.

Zeeshan Hashmi
18 minutes 27 seconds18:27
Zeeshan Hashmi 18 minutes 27 seconds
No, I said exactly.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
18 minutes 27 seconds18:27
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 27 seconds
Oh, OK.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 30 seconds
So.
Bryan Camaglia 18 minutes 47 seconds
OK, so right, so so if this was his report, it would come up and I would just look just, OK, it's blank 'cause. There's probably no no data yet and some of that. So then what I do is I click the refresh then it'll take anywhere from 1:00.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 7 seconds
To however many minutes it needs to take, and then what I do is when.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 13 seconds
It say when it does that it saves and then I hit publish.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 18 seconds
It'll ask to save.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 21 seconds
Do I have to save it?
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 26 seconds
Anyways, we'll we'll just save it anyways.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 30 seconds
Must make you save it.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 32 seconds
So then what it'll do? It'll bring up a list of workspaces.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 36 seconds
So you have to know which workspace it goes into.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 38 seconds
So like the sales report goes into the finance, you would highlight it, you hit select and then it's going to say, OK.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 46 seconds
Hey, this report exists.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 48 seconds
Do you want to replace it? Yes.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 51 seconds
If you didn't get that, then you're like, oh, maybe I picked the wrong workspace. Right? So.


Bryan Camaglia
19 minutes 55 seconds19:55
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 55 seconds
It'll ask you if you want to replace it.
Bryan Camaglia 19 minutes 57 seconds
You click yes, it'll start circling and tell you it's transferring.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 1 second
And then then it's done.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 3 seconds
Kind of a thing.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 4 seconds
So that that's kind of the deployment process that I go through.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 9 seconds
And then that's the process I go to, Steven. Yep.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
20 minutes 10 seconds20:10
Zeeshan Hashmi 20 minutes 10 seconds
Whenever there is a but this publishing we do the publishing only when there is a change in the report, right?
BC
Bryan Camaglia
20 minutes 19 seconds20:19
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 19 seconds
Correct a report.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 20 seconds
Not when there's, you know, if the tables have new data, you don't do this, right?
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 27 seconds
Yeah, that's that.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 28 seconds
That's what you know.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 30 seconds
The refresh does the data refresh the publishing kinda moves the whole.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 34 seconds
Yep, I think you.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 35 seconds
I think you got it. So the other way to see that is right.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 40 seconds
So that's when you know when you come into here. So the sales report, right?
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 47 seconds
There's two things that you're mainly concerned about, security, which we went over last time, which gets people access to the.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 53 seconds
Report and then settings. This is where.
Bryan Camaglia 20 minutes 57 seconds
Gateways are set up so this says OK and we'll go over this a second, right?
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 1 second
Like how do I connect to the data and then up here you could go refresh history and you could see OK scheduled this morning.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
21 minutes 5 seconds21:05
Zeeshan Hashmi 21 minutes 5 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
21 minutes 13 seconds21:13
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 13 seconds
It refreshed and it completed.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 14 seconds
Completed. I don't think we have any errors on this one, but usually it come in here if it errors out and you could say oh OK on that so.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
21 minutes 20 seconds21:20
Zeeshan Hashmi 21 minutes 20 seconds
M.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
21 minutes 25 seconds21:25
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 25 seconds
Now and then the gateways.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 27 seconds
This is the. This is different than the runtime, right?
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 30 seconds
We were working with the runtime, which is the way I kind of look at it is gateways is almost like sending data to the cloud and integration runtime is kind of.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 44 seconds
Data factory ish kinda stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 46 seconds
So the gateways are kinda this. You can read all about it and I'm probably not doing 100% justice, but this is gateway which is different than runtime.
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 54 seconds
So we have two gateways, right?
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 55 seconds
I started to do the one on DC1.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
21 minutes 59 seconds21:59
Zeeshan Hashmi 21 minutes 59 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
21 minutes 59 seconds21:59
Bryan Camaglia 21 minutes 59 seconds
Which will go away and then ultimately I think we're gonna set up a gateway and are you will on AZ01 and then you'll have to switch all of these reports to go through that gateway.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 9 seconds
But we we use.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 13 seconds
The main data cluster gateway.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 17 seconds
Right now, and this, this one's running on the F AP 02.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 23 seconds
So that's why we gotta get off of this before we can shut down AP02 data, one data in two in there, and then what you do is you kind of pick your database and hear what you have now you won't be able to do this.


Bryan Camaglia
22 minutes 39 seconds22:39
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 39 seconds
What you would need to do first is see I'm the.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 43 seconds
I'm the model owner right now. If you're an admin person, you could come and say hey, I want it and there'll be a button to click and you would click it and then you would be able to do this stuff too.
Bryan Camaglia 22 minutes 54 seconds
So you need to be there, but the other part then is this refresh. This is the schedule so I have it refreshing twice a day just in case it fails for some reason at the first one, then it comes back and does the second one.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
22 minutes 54 seconds22:54
Zeeshan Hashmi 22 minutes 54 seconds
Mm hmm.
Zeeshan Hashmi 23 minutes
Mm hmm.
Zeeshan Hashmi 23 minutes 10 seconds
Thank you.

Bryan Camaglia
23 minutes 11 seconds23:11
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 11 seconds
And and this is to guard against transient errors which basically says network or something whatever would have you.
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 18 seconds
So I I have that so you know if you want depending on how far.
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 24 seconds
You you wanna go on this?
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 27 seconds
Where is it?
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 30 seconds
Right send refresh failure notifications. Right now we just have it going to the model owner, which is me, but we could always add more contacts in here so you can go in here and add you or you can take over as owner.

I'm not.
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 46 seconds
You know then this way they all kind of come to you or the system it.
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 52 seconds
In there so.
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 53 seconds
So those are the main points about setting up reports, right?
Bryan Camaglia 23 minutes 57 seconds
Like so, obviously when you deploy an existing report, this is all set up and it just goes and maintains. If you send a new report, you gotta come in here and set all this up for that new report.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
24 minutes 10 seconds24:10
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 10 seconds
Alright, I will see.

Zeeshan Hashmi
24 minutes 14 seconds24:14
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 14 seconds
I will see.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 14 seconds
I will see if if we could deploy A1 test report and if you can.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 21 seconds
Give us a walk through to Josh and myself.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 24 seconds
So that would be again a great help.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 28 seconds
Because at times while doing the deployment, you might get some errors or different things so.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 35 seconds
I think that would also help us.
Zeeshan Hashmi 24 minutes 37 seconds
What do you think, Josh?

Yeah, I agree.
Josh Courson 24 minutes 43 seconds
And I did want to clarify what you were showing with those reports that would just be like if somebody requests a a change to it or if you know, like what happened the other day that turned out to not actually be an issue, but they're like, hey there.
Josh Courson 25 minutes
Some sort of issue?
Josh Courson 25 minutes 3 seconds
And them just refreshing on their side doesn't fix it.
Josh Courson 25 minutes 6 seconds
Then that's when we need to go through, check into it and potentially republish.
Josh Courson 25 minutes 11 seconds
Right. It's just like if somebody escalates an issue.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
25 minutes 15 seconds25:15
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 15 seconds
Yeah, I.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 17 seconds
Rarely. Well, I shouldn't say rarely.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 20 seconds
Yeah. I mean, if someone has an issue republishing it is is probably not.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 27 seconds
The.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 29 seconds
Gonna gonna solve it, right?
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 30 seconds
Like if it's a data issue that's different. So I would say, you know, going back to these reports.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 41 seconds
We let's just say the three of us, right, I I view.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 48 seconds
Us, the owners of you know, all these reports, right?
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 55 seconds
So let's say someone's working with.
Bryan Camaglia 25 minutes 59 seconds
The the bonus promotion data, right?
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 1 second
Like that.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 1 second
That's one of them. That kind of gets.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 5 seconds
Refreshed after each financial period. Like let's say, they're like, oh, hey, the calculation is wrong and they open a ticket.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 12 seconds
They do that right.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 14 seconds
That's our responsibility.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 15 seconds
Go in here. Come in and fix it.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 17 seconds
Let's assume it's a report issue. Then we'll save it, deploy it, and that's all within ours.

Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 37 seconds
Hey, you know what? On the facilities report, you know, I need you to publish it. Like 'cause. No one should be in here doing that.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 44 seconds
Kind of stuff.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 45 seconds
They're gonna maybe report.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 47 seconds
Hey, when I was looking at the facility fees, I saw a value for $1000.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 53 seconds
That's crazy.
Bryan Camaglia 26 minutes 54 seconds
Can you go research it? And then that'll most likely probably be a data issue. And then what would happen is you fix the data issue all the way through, and then what you would do is come back into here and and click a manual refresh to to kind.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 11 seconds
Of well, first you'd probably refresh it on the development box.
Bryan Camaglia 27 minutes 15 seconds
And then if it's good there, then you can refresh it and deploy it and then the the it'll come out live on the cloud model.


Zeeshan Hashmi
27 minutes 25 seconds27:25
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 25 seconds
Here I would request you only not, not today.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 29 seconds
Maybe next week, but we should have a one session. If somebody has changed the report, then we should be able to publish it and and if there is a new report like I know.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 42 seconds
Steve would be creating.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 45 seconds
The new report.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 46 seconds
Or maybe he would be asking to do the publish things frequently, right?
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 53 seconds
So if we would have.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 55 seconds
We we can.
Zeeshan Hashmi 27 minutes 56 seconds
We can have a walkthrough on these two items, so I think.
Zeeshan Hashmi 28 minutes 1 second

Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 23 seconds
No problem there.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 25 seconds
So. So yeah, so.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 29 seconds
So that's kind of the process when Steven says, hey, I, I need you to publish this report.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 36 seconds
So.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 39 seconds
So looking at this, the second thing is, is we had, right? So the ticket.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 46 seconds
They said that they have access but.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 51 seconds
She's saying that both Candace and Sonia.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 54 seconds
Can log in, but neither of them access to see any shops and cannot see any data in shared drive.
Bryan Camaglia 28 minutes 59 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 47 seconds
I gotta be in the silver.
Bryan Camaglia 31 minutes 54 seconds
Should I? Should probably.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 3 seconds
By name.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 13 seconds
Sonia Long is number.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 16 seconds
50 so she's in here once. One e-mail.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 21 seconds
So she should be.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 24 seconds
Let's see.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 25 seconds
Is she in here?
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 26 seconds
50 No, she should not be in these which is good.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 30 seconds
So then I'm just checking everywhere.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 32 seconds
She's not.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 33 seconds
She's shear drive.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 35 seconds
She is not in here, so let's add her.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 41 seconds
50.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 45 seconds
Make sure she didn't get put somewhere else, right?
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 47 seconds
I doubt it.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 48 seconds
Or else we would have seen it on the front end.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 51 seconds
K.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 54 seconds
Not there.
Bryan Camaglia 32 minutes 54 seconds
Not there, not there.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 1 second
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 2 seconds
So she was not in there interestingly enough.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 6 seconds
So then what we got to do is just rebuild that table.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 12 seconds
Put this back.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 16 seconds
So we'll truncate it, make sure it's empty, it is.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 27 seconds
To this final check.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 30 seconds
K.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 31 seconds
So starting tomorrow, she should have access if they're, like, urgent we need. We need her to have access today because if we go into here now, let me just.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 46 seconds
And will come back to her.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 50 seconds
Right. So I just wanna show you. Let's see, Sonia.
Bryan Camaglia 33 minutes 55 seconds
Long.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 1 second
'Cause the reason is that table is not a direct table, so it's not a live table.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 6 seconds
It needs to be part of the refresh so, but if you want right when we come back to the report, if you just want to refresh every one of these, you can and then she can have instant like an emergency. Like, hey, I need this today do the.


Bryan Camaglia
34 minutes 25 seconds34:25
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 25 seconds
Data side database side. Then you can do this side.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 28 seconds
So if you want So what I'm guessing.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 31 seconds
The issue with Candace Chin is that she had this open.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 37 seconds
We gave her access and maybe I always remind people I'm like, OK, if you don't see it at first, hit your refresh button.
Bryan Camaglia 34 minutes 45 seconds
You know, clear the cache and make sure that the stored report is actually taking the current one versus the old one, right?

That was the power BI side.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 25 seconds
I.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 26 seconds
You know, we can always ask more questions on that. I I have to say I, Josh I thanks for sending out. I have to admit though, I didn't look at it.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 32 seconds
We can look at some of that now if we want to.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 36 seconds
Or if there's other topic we wanna pivot to, I I think we'll save the punches for Monday.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 46 seconds
The whole time card punches.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 48 seconds
Because it's just it's it's a bigger topic.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 51 seconds
And so I just don't wanna run out of time and it'll be easier on Monday.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 55 seconds
But we could.
Bryan Camaglia 36 minutes 56 seconds
We could do other things, and if not I have another topic. We can always go but.

Bryan Camaglia
37 minutes 19 seconds37:19
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 19 seconds
What's? I'm sorry I missed the first part.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 22 seconds
What? What's the trigger?
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 23 seconds
What were you asking?
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
37 minutes 23 seconds37:23
Zeeshan Hashmi 37 minutes 23 seconds
Well, you know Steve is asking to for SSD power BI refreshing we did.
Zeeshan Hashmi 37 minutes 31 seconds
We did discuss.
Zeeshan Hashmi 37 minutes 34 seconds
Yesterday but we thought, OK, we should discuss it tomorrow.
Zeeshan Hashmi 37 minutes 38 seconds
So he's asking, yeah.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
37 minutes 38 seconds37:38
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 38 seconds
Oh, that's what I showed you. That's what I started with.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 41 seconds
That's what I started with.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
37 minutes 41 seconds37:41
Zeeshan Hashmi 37 minutes 41 seconds
Uh, huh. OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
37 minutes 42 seconds37:42
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 42 seconds
So when Steven says, hey, I have.
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 47 seconds
A report, the SST needs to be deployed, right? So what?
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 51 seconds
What you'll do again in here, right?
Bryan Camaglia 37 minutes 55 seconds
You'll come into the management one you'll he'll have. He'll have just. He'll name the report and say, deploy SST. This is where you'll just take it.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 6 seconds
You know, after you rename it here.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 8 seconds
Move it out of the directory.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 9 seconds
Bring it in here.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 10 seconds
Bring it up.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 10 seconds
Sanity check it, refresh it and publish it when he sends you that request.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 15 seconds
This is exactly what he's asking for.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 18 seconds
So when he says refresh he, he may interchangeably say hey can you refresh or can you you know deploy?
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 26 seconds
He's usually pretty good about it, he'll say. Deploy it.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 29 seconds
So what happened with that ticket was?
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 32 seconds
He Karen came back and said, hey, I need a change, Steven said. Great.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 37 seconds
I made a change.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 38 seconds
Brian, can you deploy the report?
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 40 seconds
So then I would see it in here.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 41 seconds
I moved it over here.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 42 seconds
I deployed it.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 43 seconds
Karen came back and said, hey, that doesn't look right. Steven looked.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 48 seconds
He goes. Oops. Yep. I used the wrong table.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 50 seconds
He changed the report yet again.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 52 seconds
Brian, can you deploy it again?
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 53 seconds
So I came in here and moved it again there. Then Karen said, hey, wait a second.
Bryan Camaglia 38 minutes 59 seconds
I thought this was retro to the first of the year, Steven said. OK.
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 3 seconds
I need to make a data change and then he said can you?
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 7 seconds
Either refresh or publish it again, and that one he sent to use is on.
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 10 seconds
So you got like the third communication on it and then I jumped in, I said Steven, that third one is a data issue.

That's just a refresh of the report that will happen tonight.
Bryan Camaglia 39 minutes 21 seconds
You do not need to deploy a new model, so that's what happened with that particular scenario.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
39 minutes 28 seconds39:28

OK.
Zeeshan Hashmi 39 minutes 28 seconds

OK.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 9 seconds
I I have to say I'm I'm a little.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 11 seconds
I would if Steven sent that to me, I would probably seek clarification from him. Even me, I I would.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
42 minutes 18 seconds42:18
Zeeshan Hashmi 42 minutes 18 seconds
In fact.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
42 minutes 18 seconds42:18
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 18 seconds
So here's here's what I think is happening. I think he's bumping against the limit here and.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
42 minutes 22 seconds42:22
Zeeshan Hashmi 42 minutes 22 seconds
Hmm.
Zeeshan Hashmi 42 minutes 25 seconds
OK, because he told me that. OK, it's better to discuss with Bryan and then come back to me. OK? I told him. OK, no problem.
Zeeshan Hashmi 42 minutes 32 seconds
Give me some time. I'll discuss it with Brian and then.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
42 minutes 34 seconds42:34
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 34 seconds
See.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 36 seconds
Yeah. So so to me this is a little vague, right?


Bryan Camaglia
42 minutes 42 seconds42:42
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 42 seconds
Can't. So. So there's a couple things like I showed Steven. Like I think he wants to.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 49 seconds
He wants to deploy some reports. I think he's doing some stuff with Karen. And So what?
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
42 minutes 54 seconds42:54
Zeeshan Hashmi 42 minutes 54 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
42 minutes 55 seconds42:55
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 55 seconds
I usually try to do is.
Bryan Camaglia 42 minutes 57 seconds
And and Steven moves fast and kind of does his things. But I always try to be the the Yang to the Yang, right?
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 4 seconds
And, like, bring a little like well.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 5 seconds
I'd still like to be part of the at least deployment process.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 8 seconds
Just, I said.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 9 seconds
You know, for my awareness and support and he understands that. So sometimes he may move a little quickly, but this is kind of just can you refresh the daily SST report as I'm still not able to do this so so.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 24 seconds
What Steven?
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 24 seconds
I think.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 27 seconds
Wants to become like admin on a couple of them, but I I'm really sure why and I'm not really sure where he's having trouble refreshing this.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 35 seconds
Because this is kind of an odd request.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 38 seconds
And he still.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 39 seconds
And then you were like, hey, do you still have the issue?
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 41 seconds
And he's like, yes, I do.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 43 seconds
O the refresh is kind of odd, but as you can see it's been refreshing without any issue.
Bryan Camaglia 43 minutes 50 seconds
So that's why I'm confused. Like well, where are you trying to refresh this, Steven. Right, like we're we've been refreshing daily without issues twice a day, right?
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes
So I'm I'm kind of a little puzzled by that.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 3 seconds
So then what I'm gonna do is.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 7 seconds
I this is the report here.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
44 minutes 10 seconds44:10
Zeeshan Hashmi 44 minutes 10 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
44 minutes 11 seconds44:11
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 11 seconds
And so the other thing that I would say is.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 14 seconds
If he had in his deployment, if he had just SST without dash copy or a date or anything in there, then I would say, oh, Steven, are you looking for me to deploy this copied over and deploy it? But these two do not look ready to go so.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
44 minutes 25 seconds44:25
Zeeshan Hashmi 44 minutes 25 seconds
Mm hmm.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
44 minutes 33 seconds44:33
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 33 seconds
I don't know what's going on there. And so now I'm just going to hit this is going to take a little while.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 40 seconds
But I'm going to.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 41 seconds
I'm going to just try to refresh it, just as if he was refreshing it.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 45 seconds
And I want to see if it errors out.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 47 seconds
So what I'm wondering is that is he doing development work and now he wants to refresh it and it's having an issue and so.
Bryan Camaglia 44 minutes 58 seconds
OK, side note so.
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 2 seconds
He built queries like native queries into this.


Bryan Camaglia
45 minutes 5 seconds45:05
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 5 seconds
This is and I've tried to work with him, but this is bad practice, right? You know this?
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 11 seconds
This should all be done first of all in a database level.
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 14 seconds
Let alone this should be done through the whole transformation but.
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 21 seconds
You know, as the as they say, you know, there's, you know, only so many things you can tackle at once and so.
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 28 seconds
He's he's reduced a lot of that stuff in there so.

Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 34 seconds

Bryan Camaglia
45 minutes 50 seconds45:50
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 50 seconds
He he's a he's he's kind of, he's he serves as kind of a data scientist kind of guy, right?
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 57 seconds
So he's a lab guy, right?
Bryan Camaglia 45 minutes 59 seconds
So he's gonna go and.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 2 seconds
Forth and conquer, right?
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 3 seconds
That's just where his mindset is.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 5 seconds
And I think there's anything wrong with that.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 6 seconds
It's just.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 7 seconds
Giving you some background in it. So as you can see right when he pulls in these tables, right, he's pulling in.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 14 seconds
Tables with millions of rows and so this gets pretty unwieldy or gets to the limit there.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 23 seconds
But let's see.
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 46 seconds
And you can see he's got basically a ton of tables, right?
Bryan Camaglia 46 minutes 51 seconds
So that's why it's so big.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 7 seconds
You know, Josh to your question, I I should say I I feel like that I I I should know better than to definitively say anything.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 14 seconds
I mean.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 16 seconds
You know, maybe.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 18 seconds
I don't think so.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 19 seconds
But you know, as as we all know, being around this stuff long enough, stranger things have happened so.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 26 seconds
But but I I feel like he's my first inclination.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 30 seconds
Is that he's starting to run against the size limit, although the error would come back and say too big and he should.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 37 seconds
See that? So if this successfully refreshes.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 44 seconds
What we'll do Zeeshan, is I'm going to reply to that e-mail. You forward to me and I'll be like Steven, I even.
Bryan Camaglia 47 minutes 50 seconds
I'm not sure what you're asking here, so let me help. Try to bridge the gap.

Yep, I got it.
JC
Josh Courson
48 minutes 50 seconds48:50
Josh Courson 48 minutes 50 seconds
So yeah, I just kind of color-coded everything for what's done and you know my time in green ADP, orange and then kind of transfers between azio one and O2.
Josh Courson 49 minutes 1 second
So you know, I'm sure some more clarification can be added, but just kinda rough thing to you know the manager set the schedule and then they're moved to date until two where the employee data is pulled from.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
49 minutes 9 seconds49:09
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 9 seconds
Yeah.
JC
Josh Courson
49 minutes 15 seconds49:15
Josh Courson 49 minutes 15 seconds
ADP umm.
Josh Courson 49 minutes 17 seconds
That's then sent back to AZ 01 combined into schedule or or into a combined schedule.
Josh Courson 49 minutes 26 seconds
Then back over to data int O2 and upload it to ADP. The combined schedules.
Josh Courson 49 minutes 33 seconds
That all good so far.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
49 minutes 36 seconds49:36
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 36 seconds
So let's see manager set schedule if if you want and and and this is a good I get it.
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 43 seconds
So we're just refining, right?
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 44 seconds
So in that first one, maybe if you want to manage that schedule, what was green again?
JC
Josh Courson
49 minutes 49 seconds49:49

My time.

Sorry, I forgot about that part.
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 53 seconds
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 53 seconds
Yep, Nope, that's right. Scheduled. Moved from.
Bryan Camaglia 49 minutes 57 seconds
Arizona 012 employee data combined with schedule.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
50 minutes 4 seconds50:04
Zeeshan Hashmi 50 minutes 4 seconds
I guess the schedule moved from the my tank to the easy one and the the data int O2.
Zeeshan Hashmi 50 minutes 11 seconds
Is that correct or?
BC
Bryan Camaglia
50 minutes 14 seconds50:14
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 14 seconds
Well again, right?
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 15 seconds
You know, if we're going to stick to high level, I would almost say schedule moved.
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 21 seconds
It goes yeah, from my time.
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 25 seconds
To and I would just go AZ01 slash data into and we'll treat because it's split because it's split processing.
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 34 seconds
Let's treat them as one, right?


Bryan Camaglia
50 minutes 36 seconds50:36
Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 36 seconds
And then if you ever wanted to get to the next layer down, we could determine what's done on AZ101 and what's done on data INT 2.

Josh Courson 50 minutes 44 seconds

Bryan Camaglia 50 minutes 58 seconds
Well, it doesn't it to to be to be very specific, it first goes to.
JC
Josh Courson
50 minutes 59 seconds50:59
Josh Courson 50 minutes 59 seconds
Alright.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
51 minutes 6 seconds51:06
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 6 seconds
AZ, 01, and then then it's moved back and forth.
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 10 seconds
Then then the actual processing happens on both of those machines, and it goes back and forth back and forth, kind of a thing until it's done.
JC
Josh Courson
51 minutes 13 seconds51:13
Josh Courson 51 minutes 13 seconds
Mm hmm.
Josh Courson 51 minutes 18 seconds
OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
51 minutes 18 seconds51:18
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 18 seconds
So that's why it's like at at this level, I think that fits the bill and it it, it shows that, hey, listen, there's processing being done both on AZ 01.
JC
Josh Courson
51 minutes 19 seconds51:19
Josh Courson 51 minutes 19 seconds
Gotcha.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
51 minutes 28 seconds51:28
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 28 seconds
As well as data int O2.
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 29 seconds
So I think that's the important thing. Employee data combined with schedules, what is is that orange rate in ADP?
JC
Josh Courson
51 minutes 30 seconds51:30
Josh Courson 51 minutes 30 seconds
OK. Gotcha.
Josh Courson 51 minutes 39 seconds
Yeah. So that's yeah, 'cause, I think that was what you talked about where it pulls in like the wages and you know all that fun stuff for employees that have.
Josh Courson 51 minutes 48 seconds
Are are on the schedule for the next two weeks.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
51 minutes 48 seconds51:48
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 48 seconds
Yep.
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 51 seconds
Yeah. Can you also put employee data and punches?
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 56 seconds
'Cause, I think that's very important, right?
Bryan Camaglia 51 minutes 58 seconds
So employees punch in and out of ADP and it's that information that is combined with the schedules. Yep.
JC
Josh Courson
51 minutes 59 seconds51:59
Josh Courson 51 minutes 59 seconds
OK.
Josh Courson 52 minutes 6 seconds
OK, gotcha. And that's where I may need to come by these 'cause. I did kind of that flow and then I have like here's the punches and you know goes further from there.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
52 minutes 8 seconds52:08
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 8 seconds
Yep.
JC
Josh Courson
52 minutes 16 seconds52:16
Josh Courson 52 minutes 16 seconds
So yeah.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
52 minutes 17 seconds52:17
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 17 seconds
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 19 seconds
Then purple is data int.
JC
Josh Courson
52 minutes 25 seconds52:25
Josh Courson 52 minutes 25 seconds
So that's where it said it. You were talking about. It was sent to because ADP only interacts with data int O2.
Josh Courson 52 minutes 33 seconds
It's then sent back to Azure one.
Josh Courson 52 minutes 38 seconds
For kind of the processing to combine everything.
Josh Courson 52 minutes 42 seconds
That right?
BC
Bryan Camaglia
52 minutes 46 seconds52:46
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 46 seconds
So actually the first top three are probably the the whole schedule process, but if we wanna build this out then what happens is that.
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 57 seconds
Then what comes out of ADP?
Bryan Camaglia 52 minutes 59 seconds
What comes out of that orange are the time cards, right?
Bryan Camaglia 53 minutes 3 seconds
So then, so then the combined information, then I would say now we're we're pulling out.

JC
Josh Courson
53 minutes 46 seconds53:46
Josh Courson 53 minutes 46 seconds
Yeah. So I think I kind of split out where this is more or less like the schedule flow and then this is the, I mean it's still related to schedule, but like the actual kind of payment side, I guess.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
53 minutes 47 seconds53:47
Bryan Camaglia 53 minutes 47 seconds
OK.
Bryan Camaglia 54 minutes 3 seconds
But the time, time card and Commission. OK, yeah, I think.
JC
Josh Courson
54 minutes 6 seconds54:06
Josh Courson 54 minutes 6 seconds
Yeah.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
54 minutes 11 seconds54:11
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 11 seconds
One thing one thing.
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 15 seconds
Josh.
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 18 seconds
As Brian mentioned, on the second step where the schedules move from my time to the AZ 01 and data 02, I guess there is some back and forth process in between these databases because it doesn't update the AZ01AD and data INT 02.
JC
Josh Courson
54 minutes 25 seconds54:25
Josh Courson 54 minutes 25 seconds
Mm hmm.
Josh Courson 54 minutes 38 seconds
Mm hmm.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
54 minutes 39 seconds54:39
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 39 seconds
Databases.
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 40 seconds
Simultaneously.
JC
Josh Courson
54 minutes 42 seconds54:42
Josh Courson 54 minutes 42 seconds
Yeah.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
54 minutes 43 seconds54:43
Zeeshan Hashmi 54 minutes 43 seconds
So we we might need to add few steps for the pack and forth as well.
JC
Josh Courson
54 minutes 49 seconds54:49
Josh Courson 54 minutes 49 seconds
Yeah, and that's what I believe was kind of this stuff is it goes to data int O2 to combine with the ADP data employee data punch. All that fun stuff.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 3 seconds
But then for Azure one to kind of combine everything and then back to two.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 13 seconds
Where it's, you know, loaded to ADP.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 17 seconds
So, and that's where like.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 20 seconds
Yeah. Really just.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 22 seconds
All the back and forth.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
55 minutes 24 seconds55:24
Zeeshan Hashmi 55 minutes 24 seconds
Uh huh.
JC
Josh Courson
55 minutes 25 seconds55:25
Josh Courson 55 minutes 25 seconds
A little confusing, so I think I'd understand the flow.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 27 seconds
But you know, when we're like, all right, this is schedule, but then clock in and out and like payment. Is that the same as schedule? And really we we'll need to add in like I haven't done you know the second day's report yet of like all the.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 41 seconds
Tips to see how that factors into the workflow.
Josh Courson 55 minutes 44 seconds
So obviously it's gonna get more complicated.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
55 minutes 47 seconds55:47
Zeeshan Hashmi 55 minutes 47 seconds

ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
55 minutes 49 seconds55:49
Zeeshan Hashmi 55 minutes 49 seconds
I would.
Zeeshan Hashmi 55 minutes 50 seconds
I would suggest we're here if you add.
Zeeshan Hashmi 55 minutes 56 seconds
The the missing steps on this this sheet and if you can send the editable to the blind.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 4 seconds
So Brian, I would request you if you can have a look and would you like to make some changes if we are doing wrong or or do you think that OK, something has been missed, missed out in this data flow diagram. So by the next week at least?
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 22 seconds
We would have the high level.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 24 seconds
You know.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 25 seconds
The flow diagram.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 26 seconds
Then we would be able to create some documentation.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
56 minutes 32 seconds56:32

Oh yeah, happy to.

BC
Bryan Camaglia
56 minutes 33 seconds56:33
Bryan Camaglia 56 minutes 33 seconds
Happy to help.
Bryan Camaglia 56 minutes 34 seconds
So you want me to take this document here? Yeah.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
56 minutes 36 seconds56:36
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 36 seconds
Yes, to validate all this thing.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 38 seconds
Yep. So I would request right now that Scott, Josh that OK if he can edit the few things, what you have recommended right now and then send it over to you, copy to me as well. And if you get a chance over the weekend maybe today, so just.
Zeeshan Hashmi 56 minutes 57 seconds
Tweak just do some tweaking on this sheet and then on Monday morning we would be able to have.
Zeeshan Hashmi 57 minutes 3 seconds
Finalize this flow diagram.
Zeeshan Hashmi 57 minutes 5 seconds
Because we have to create the documentation, we have to share this documentation that OK how this process is working because everyone is now.
Zeeshan Hashmi 57 minutes 16 seconds
In a.
Zeeshan Hashmi 57 minutes 16 seconds
In a in a shape that will get their way where they should be able to get the high level documentation that how the entire process is working and that's that's the right now it's missing part.

I I may give it to you, Josh and just e-mail format. I may not spend the time on the on the boxes and then you can bring that back so.
JC

No, that's good.

Josh Courson
57 minutes 49 seconds57:49
Josh Courson 57 minutes 49 seconds
I only have my own like basic copy of office. I was gonna ask.
Josh Courson 57 minutes 54 seconds
I don't know if we could get access to Visio or anything like that through either Floyd's or elevate, because that would make this a whole lot easier. 'cause I know they're like if you want to add something you just add something, whereas this it's all like man.

Stupid arrows that need to be adjusted and crap so you know.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
58 minutes 11 seconds58:11
Bryan Camaglia 58 minutes 11 seconds
Well, I don't.
Bryan Camaglia 58 minutes 11 seconds
I don't have Visio right now either, so that's why I was making sure it wasn't.
JC
Josh Courson
58 minutes 14 seconds58:14
Josh Courson 58 minutes 14 seconds
OK.
BC
Bryan Camaglia
58 minutes 14 seconds58:14
Bryan Camaglia 58 minutes 14 seconds
But I agree with you.
Bryan Camaglia 58 minutes 15 seconds
It's probably easier, but I'll I'll get you something here today so that you can, OK.
JC
Josh Courson
58 minutes 20 seconds58:20
Josh Courson 58 minutes 20 seconds
Alright, cool.
Josh Courson 58 minutes 22 seconds
Yeah, I'll go ahead and send this over just as a start and then I can also work on trying to, you know, add in the the tips and other stuff and and yeah, just you send back notes even if you just like add comments or whatever or you.
Josh Courson 58 minutes 39 seconds
Know add a new sheet with you know a workflow. Whatever you know I can work on the visuals. You don't need to waste your time with that so.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
58 minutes 49 seconds58:49
Zeeshan Hashmi 58 minutes 49 seconds
One more thing, Josh, we we can use lucid chart as well.
Zeeshan Hashmi 58 minutes 54 seconds
It's pretty much free because Visio is probably good for the networking diagram only and nobody use it, and it requires that you know the license as well. So we can use the lucid as well. And in fact, once if if you have a high level diagram over here.
JC
Josh Courson
59 minutes59:00
Josh Courson 59 minutes
OK.
ZH
Zeeshan Hashmi
59 minutes 12 seconds59:12
Zeeshan Hashmi 59 minutes 12 seconds
So I can replicate all those things on the lucid as well.
Zeeshan Hashmi 59 minutes 15 seconds
That's that's not an issue.
